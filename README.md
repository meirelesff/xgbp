`xgbp` provides a flexible and fast framework for multivel regression
with poststratification (MrP) by combining Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGB) with traditional poststratification. Estimates can be aggregated
at different group-levels for both binomial and multinomial dependent
variables.

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
